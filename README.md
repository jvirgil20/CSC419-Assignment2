## Exercise 3.1
exercise1.c is the source code for Exercise 3.1. I tested it using the GCC compiler and the executable file is included as 'ex1'

## Exercise 3.3
a) exercise3a.py & exercise3a.rb are the source codes for a quick demonstration of string im/mutability in python and ruby, respectively. I tested both directly from the terminal.
